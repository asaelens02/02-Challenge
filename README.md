Goal: Refactor starter code for Horiseon website

Language: HTML and CSS

Procedure: 
I began by looking at the starter code HTML and the website image. Using a piece of paper, I broke down the structure of the website and identified what divisions in the HTML file could be updated using semantic HTML. I was able to relabel some divisions as header, section, navigation, and article elements. As I was working on this, I also adjusted the spacing between lines and added labels to each section, so they were easy to identify. I also made sure to test the webpage as I changed things and I adjusted small parts of the CSS file as needed to keep the format of the website while I was working. 

Once I was somewhat happy with the new structure using semantic HTML, I moved on to checking links and adding alt and title elements to the images. I discovered the Search Engine Optimization link in the navigation element didnâ€™t work so I was able to add an id and fix it. 

Next, I moved on to the CSS file, I noticed several elements had the same features in the benefits and products sections of the CSS. To amend this to more concise code I re-classified some elements in the HTML file and was able to achieve the same result on the webpage. I also labeled the sections of the CSS to match the HTML file, so they are easy to identify as well. To complete the document, I reorganized the CSS file so that all the different elements were grouped together under their respective sections; header elements are together, benefits elements are together, etc. 

As I worked through this, I made sure to make git commits when I had finished tedious or lengthy changes to either the HTML or CSS files.
